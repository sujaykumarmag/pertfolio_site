By leveraging a decentralized and immutable ledger, the system eliminates the risk of voter fraud and hacking, and provides a transparent and automated voting process. The system is accessible and user-friendly, making it an ideal solution for remote and absentee voting. This system is made by using Hardhat, Ethereum smart contracts, and React would be a decentralized platform for voting. The system would use cryptography to ensure secure, anonymous, and auditable votes, with a front-end built in React and the back-end using Ethereum smart contracts, deployed with Goerli Testnet.",
